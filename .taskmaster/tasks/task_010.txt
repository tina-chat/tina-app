# Task ID: 10
# Title: Add Streaming Response Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time streaming with stop generation and smooth UI updates
# Details:
Enhance streaming implementation with token-by-token display using StreamBuilder, typing indicators while AI is generating, stop generation button that cancels the stream, smooth text animation during streaming, and proper cleanup of stream subscriptions. Optimize performance with debounced UI updates and efficient list rebuilding using keys.

# Test Strategy:
Performance tests for streaming UI updates, functionality tests for stop generation, memory leak testing for stream cleanup, and stress testing with rapid message sending

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhance UI with StreamBuilder for Real-time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement StreamBuilder widget to display streaming responses in real-time with proper state management
### Details:
Create StreamBuilder implementation in chat UI to listen to streaming responses. Replace static message display with dynamic streaming updates. Handle different stream states (waiting, active, completed, error) with appropriate UI feedback. Integrate with existing chat bloc to receive streaming data and update UI smoothly.

## 2. Implement Token-by-token Text Display with Smooth Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create smooth text animation system that displays AI responses character by character as they arrive
### Details:
Implement AnimatedTextKit or custom animation controller for smooth text appearance. Create typewriter effect that shows tokens as they arrive from the stream. Add configurable animation speed and smooth transitions. Ensure animations are performant and don't block UI updates during rapid token arrival.

## 3. Add Typing Indicators During AI Response Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement visual indicators to show when AI is actively generating a response
### Details:
Create typing indicator widget with animated dots or pulse effect. Display indicator during streaming states and hide when complete or stopped. Position indicator appropriately in chat UI. Add loading shimmer effect for message container during generation. Ensure indicator responds correctly to stream state changes.

## 4. Create Stop Generation Button with Stream Cancellation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement stop button that allows users to cancel ongoing AI response generation
### Details:
Add stop generation button that appears during streaming. Implement stream cancellation logic in chat bloc to properly terminate ongoing requests. Handle partial response preservation when stopped. Provide visual feedback for stop action and ensure clean state transition. Test cancellation at different stages of response generation.

## 5. Optimize Performance with Debounced UI Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Implement debouncing and performance optimizations for smooth streaming UI updates
### Details:
Add debouncing mechanism to prevent excessive UI rebuilds during rapid token arrival. Implement efficient text buffer management for streaming updates. Use Timer or RxDart debouncing to batch UI updates. Optimize ListView rebuilding with proper keys and minimal widget reconstruction. Monitor and optimize memory usage during streaming.

## 6. Implement Proper Stream Subscription Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.4
### Description: Ensure proper disposal of stream subscriptions to prevent memory leaks
### Details:
Implement comprehensive cleanup logic in chat bloc dispose method. Cancel all active stream subscriptions on widget disposal or navigation. Add subscription management with proper error handling and resource cleanup. Create stream subscription pool for managing multiple concurrent streams. Test for memory leaks and ensure proper resource disposal.

## 7. Add Performance Testing and Memory Leak Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Implement performance monitoring and testing for streaming features with memory leak detection
### Details:
Create performance tests for streaming UI updates and measure frame rates during streaming. Implement memory leak detection tests for stream subscriptions. Add performance monitoring for token processing speed and UI responsiveness. Create stress tests with rapid message sending and long streaming sessions. Document performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations.
