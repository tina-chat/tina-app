# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Chat Bloc State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create BLoC pattern implementation for chat state management with proper events and states
# Details:
Create lib/features/chat/bloc/chat_bloc.dart with ChatBloc extending Bloc<ChatEvent, ChatState>. Define events: SendMessage, StopGeneration, ClearChat. Define states: ChatInitial, ChatLoading, ChatReady(List<Message> messages, bool isStreaming), ChatError(String error). Implement event handlers with proper state transitions and error handling using try-catch blocks.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each event handler, state transitions, error scenarios, and bloc state persistence during streaming

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ChatEvent Abstract Class and Concrete Events [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the abstract ChatEvent class and implement concrete event classes: SendMessage, StopGeneration, and ClearChat with proper parameters and validation
### Details:
Create abstract ChatEvent class in lib/features/chat/bloc/chat_event.dart. Implement SendMessage event with required message parameter and validation. Create StopGeneration event for canceling ongoing operations. Implement ClearChat event for resetting chat history. Add proper documentation and type safety.

## 2. Create ChatState Abstract Class and Concrete States [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the abstract ChatState class and implement all concrete state classes with proper data structures and equality
### Details:
Create abstract ChatState class in lib/features/chat/bloc/chat_state.dart. Implement ChatInitial for initial state, ChatLoading for processing states, ChatReady with messages list and isStreaming flag, and ChatError with error message. Add Equatable implementation for proper state comparison and rebuild optimization.

## 3. Implement ChatBloc Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create the main ChatBloc class extending Bloc with proper initialization, dependency injection, and event registration
### Details:
Create ChatBloc class in lib/features/chat/bloc/chat_bloc.dart extending Bloc<ChatEvent, ChatState>. Set up constructor with required dependencies, initialize with ChatInitial state, and register event handlers. Add proper disposal methods and stream subscription management for cleanup.

## 4. Implement SendMessage Event Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create comprehensive SendMessage event handler with streaming support, error handling, and proper state transitions
### Details:
Implement _onSendMessage handler with try-catch error handling. Add message to state, emit ChatLoading, integrate with AI service for streaming responses, handle token-by-token updates, and emit ChatReady with updated messages. Include proper error handling and state rollback on failures.

## 5. Implement StopGeneration and ClearChat Event Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create event handlers for stopping message generation and clearing chat history with proper cleanup
### Details:
Implement _onStopGeneration handler to cancel active stream subscriptions and update isStreaming flag. Create _onClearChat handler to reset messages list and return to ChatInitial state. Ensure proper cleanup of resources and state consistency during transitions.

## 6. Add Comprehensive Unit Tests for ChatBloc [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Create complete test suite covering all event handlers, state transitions, error scenarios, and edge cases
### Details:
Create test/features/chat/bloc/chat_bloc_test.dart with bloc_test framework. Test initial state, all event handlers, error scenarios, state transitions, stream cancellation, and concurrent event handling. Include edge cases like rapid message sending and network failures. Ensure 100% code coverage for the bloc implementation.
