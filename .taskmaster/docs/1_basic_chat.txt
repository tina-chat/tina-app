# PRD-01: Basic Chat Interface

## User Value Proposition
Enable users to have natural conversations with an AI assistant through a clean, intuitive chat interface with real-time streaming responses.

## User Stories (Vertical Slices)
- As a user, I want to send messages to an AI assistant so that I can get helpful responses
- As a user, I want to see AI responses appear in real-time so that I know the system is working
- As a user, I want to easily distinguish between my messages and AI responses so that I can follow the conversation
- As a user, I want to see when the AI is thinking/processing so that I know to wait

## Success Criteria
- User can type a message and press send/enter to submit
- Message appears immediately in chat with "sending" indicator
- AI response streams in real-time, token by token
- User can send another message while AI is responding
- Chat maintains scrolling position appropriately
- Clear visual distinction between user and AI messages
- Loading/thinking indicator while AI processes
- Stop generation button appears during streaming
- Messages display timestamps
- Code blocks render with proper formatting

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```yaml
packages/features/chat/:
  - ui/chat_screen.dart           # Main chat interface
  - ui/message_bubble.dart        # Message display widget
  - ui/message_input.dart          # Input field with send button
  - bloc/chat_bloc.dart            # State management
  - models/message.dart            # Message entity

packages/infrastructure/providers/:
  - openai_provider/               # Initial AI provider (OpenAI)
    - openai_client.dart           # API client implementation
    - streaming_handler.dart       # SSE stream processing
```

### Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.3             # State management
  dio: ^5.3.3                      # HTTP client
  flutter_client_sse: ^2.0.0       # SSE streaming
  flutter_markdown: ^0.6.18        # Message formatting
```

### Data Models
```dart
class Message {
  final String id;
  final String content;
  final MessageRole role;          // user, assistant, system
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final MessageStatus status;       // sending, sent, streaming, complete, error
}
```

### State Management
```dart
abstract class ChatState {}
class ChatInitial extends ChatState {}
class ChatLoading extends ChatState {}
class ChatReady extends ChatState {
  final List<Message> messages;
  final bool isStreaming;
}
class ChatError extends ChatState {
  final String error;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Chat UI
1. Create basic Flutter app structure
2. Implement chat screen layout
3. Build message bubble widget
4. Create message input component
5. Set up basic navigation

### Week 2: AI Integration & Streaming
1. Implement OpenAI provider
2. Add SSE streaming handler
3. Connect chat bloc to provider
4. Implement real-time message streaming
5. Add error handling and retry logic

## Out of Scope (for this PRD)
- Multiple chats/conversations
- Chat persistence/history
- Multiple AI providers
- User authentication
- Settings/configuration
- Search functionality
- Export capabilities
- Advanced formatting (images, files)

## Dependencies
- Flutter SDK setup
- OpenAI API key for testing
- Basic project structure

## What This Enables for Future PRDs
- Foundation for chat persistence (PRD-02)
- Base for multi-chat management (PRD-03)
- Interface for provider switching (PRD-04)
- Starting point for advanced features

## Acceptance Tests
1. **Send Message Test**: User types "Hello" → Message appears → AI responds
2. **Streaming Test**: Long AI response streams token by token
3. **Stop Generation Test**: User can stop mid-stream
4. **Error Handling Test**: Invalid API key shows error message
5. **Code Block Test**: Request code → Proper formatting applied
6. **Multiple Messages Test**: Send 5 messages rapidly → All processed in order

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Chat interface renders on mobile (iOS/Android)
- [ ] User can send messages
- [ ] AI responses stream in real-time
- [ ] Visual distinction between user/AI messages
- [ ] Stop generation works
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Code reviewed and tested
- [ ] Basic documentation written
