			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into manageable chunks: update dependencies, create folder structure, remove default code, verify monorepo configuration, test code generation, and validate architectural patterns",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. The melos configuration exists and pubspec.yaml has some dependencies. Main work is adding missing dependencies (flutter_bloc, dio, flutter_markdown, equatable), creating folder structure following Clean Architecture, and removing default counter app. The monorepo structure is already established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Core Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive data models with proper DDD implementation: design Message value object, implement enums, add validation, create serialization, write comprehensive tests, and establish business rules",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Requires implementing DDD Value Objects with freezed and json_serializable (packages already configured). Need to create proper domain models with validation, business rules, and comprehensive testing. The task involves multiple interconnected models and proper architectural patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Chat Bloc State Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement BLoC pattern step by step: create events and states, build bloc structure, implement event handlers with streaming support, add comprehensive testing covering all scenarios",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. BLoC pattern implementation with streaming support, proper state management, and error handling. Need to integrate with OpenAI streaming responses which adds complexity. Requires comprehensive testing for various state transitions and stream management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build OpenAI Provider Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build robust OpenAI integration: create client with Dio, implement streaming SSE handling, add comprehensive error handling, create proper models, and test various scenarios including failures",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Implementing streaming API integration with Server-Sent Events parsing, proper error handling for various API scenarios, and comprehensive testing. The http package exists but need to add Dio. SSE parsing and stream management adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Message Input Widget",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive input widget: create basic structure, implement multiline support, add keyboard handling, create loading states, implement validation, add accessibility, and integrate with design system tokens",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Creating a StatefulWidget with multiline support, keyboard shortcuts (Enter vs Shift+Enter), loading states, validation, and proper Material Design 3 integration using the existing design system tokens. Requires good UX implementation and accessibility features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Bubble Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create stylized message bubbles: implement basic structure, add role-based styling, integrate markdown rendering, create status indicators, add timestamps, implement responsive design, and follow design system tokens",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Creating a StatelessWidget with role-based styling (user/AI), markdown rendering with flutter_markdown (need to add to pubspec), status indicators, and responsive design. Integration with design system tokens is well-defined but requires careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Main Chat Screen",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create main chat interface: build basic structure, implement AppBar with controls, create scrollable message list, integrate input widget, add auto-scroll functionality, and handle keyboard interactions",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Combining existing components into a cohesive interface with BlocBuilder integration. Need to implement proper scrolling behavior, keyboard handling, and state management integration. Less complex than individual components since it's mostly composition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Chat Components with BLoC",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Wire all components together: set up providers, connect events, implement state builders, add side effects handling, create loading indicators, implement stop generation, and add comprehensive error handling",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Integration layer that connects all previous components with proper state management. Need to handle BlocProvider setup, event dispatching, state listening, side effects, and error handling. This is where all pieces come together and often reveals integration issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Loading States",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive error system: create error handler structure, define error types, implement retry logic, build error UI components, create loading states, add connection indicators, set up logging foundation, implement provider pattern, and write thorough tests",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Creating a comprehensive error handling system following the monorepo architecture with proper package separation. Need to implement retry mechanisms with the existing http package, create error UI components with design system integration, and handle various error scenarios. Provider pattern integration adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Streaming Response Features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Enhance streaming experience: implement StreamBuilder integration, create smooth text animations, add typing indicators, build stop generation functionality, optimize performance, ensure proper cleanup, and add comprehensive testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Advanced streaming features with real-time UI updates, performance optimization, and proper resource management. Need to handle StreamBuilder integration, smooth animations, stop functionality, and potential memory leaks. Performance optimization and testing adds significant complexity."
