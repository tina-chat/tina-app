### Memory-Aware Solution Generation Workflow
1. **Context Discovery**: Use serena_list_memories and serena_read_memory to understand project background
2. **Structured Thinking**: Use sequential-thinking for creative exploration and analysis
3. **Solution Generation**: Generate 6 diverse approaches based on context
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluate solutions against multiple criteria
5. **Decision Making**: Select optimal solution with clear rationale
6. **Memory Storage**: Use serena_write_memory to preserve results and rationale

## Unified Solution Generation Process

### 1. Context Discovery (Memory-Aware)
When given a problem:
1. **Discover Historical Context**: Use serena_list_memories to find related decisions and patterns
2. **Read Project Context**: Use serena_read_memory to understand:
   - Existing solutions and patterns
   - Previous brainstorming sessions and decisions
   - Project constraints and preferences
   - Technology stack and architecture
   - Historical decision outcomes
3. **Identify Core Challenge**: What is the fundamental issue to solve?
4. **Extract Constraints**: What are the limitations and requirements?
5. **Define Success**: What does a successful solution look like?
6. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Who is affected by this decision?

### 2. Structured Creative Thinking & Analysis
Use sequential-thinking to:
1. **Explore Problem Space**: Break down the problem into components
2. **Question Assumptions**: Challenge existing constraints and approaches
3. **Generate Solution Hypotheses**: Create initial solution concepts
4. **Historical Pattern Comparison**: Compare against past solutions and outcomes
5. **Multi-Criteria Analysis**: Evaluate solutions across feasibility, impact, risk, and alignment
6. **Decision Synthesis**: Select optimal solution with clear rationale

### 3. Solution Generation (Context-Informed)
Generate exactly 6 distinct solution approaches, each from a different perspective, informed by project context:

**Perspective 1: Simple & Direct**
- Most straightforward implementation
- Minimal complexity
- Quick to implement

- Enterprise-grade solution
- Handles growth and complexity
- Long-term maintainability

**Perspective 3: Innovative & Modern**
- Cutting-edge approaches
- Latest technologies/patterns
- Forward-thinking design

**Perspective 4: Resource-Efficient**
- Minimal resource usage
- Optimized for performance
- Cost-effective implementation

**Perspective 5: User-Centric**
- Focus on user experience
- Intuitive and accessible
- Human-centered design

**Perspective 6: Alternative Paradigm**
- Completely different approach
- Challenges assumptions
- Out-of-the-box thinking

### 4. Comprehensive Solution Analysis
For each solution, analyze across these criteria:

**Feasibility Assessment**
- Technical feasibility: Can this be implemented?
- Resource feasibility: Do we have the resources?
- Timeline feasibility: Can this be done in required time?
- Skill feasibility: Do we have the necessary skills?

**Impact Assessment**
- Problem resolution: How well does it solve the problem?
- User impact: How does it affect users?
- System impact: How does it affect the overall system?
- Business impact: What are the business implications?

**Risk Assessment**
- Implementation risk: What could go wrong during implementation?
- Operational risk: What could go wrong in production?
- Maintenance risk: How difficult is it to maintain?
- Dependency risk: What external dependencies does it create?

**Alignment Assessment**
- Strategic alignment: Does it align with business goals?
- Architectural alignment: Does it fit our architecture?
- Team alignment: Does it match team capabilities?
- Historical alignment: Does it follow successful patterns?

### 5. Decision Making
Select the optimal solution based on:
- **Highest Overall Score**: Best balance across all criteria
- **Risk-Adjusted Value**: Best value considering risks
- **Strategic Fit**: Best alignment with long-term goals
- **Implementation Reality**: Most practical to implement
- **Historical Success**: Similar solutions that worked well in the past
- **Pattern Alignment**: Solutions that follow successful decision patterns

## Solution Structuring

For each solution, provide:
- **Concept**: Clear description of the approach
- **Implementation**: How it would work
- **Pros**: Advantages and benefits
- **Cons**: Disadvantages and challenges
- **Complexity**: Implementation difficulty (Low/Medium/High)
- **Feasibility Score**: 1-10 rating
- **Impact Score**: 1-10 rating
- **Risk Score**: 1-10 rating (lower is better)
- **Alignment Score**: 1-10 rating
- **Historical Precedent**: Similar solutions from past decisions
- **Best For**: When this approach is most suitable

## Memory-Aware Workflows

### Before Solution Generation
```bash
# Discover relevant historical context
serena_list_memories

# Read specific decision memories if found
serena_read_memory(memory_file_name="similar_decisions")
serena_read_memory(memory_file_name="project_context")
serena_read_memory(memory_file_name="solution_patterns")
```

### After Solution Generation
```bash
# Store complete solution analysis and decision
serena_write_memory(memory_name="solution_decision_[date]", content="[full analysis and decision report]")
```

### Building on Previous Ideas
- Reference similar problems solved in the past
- Adapt successful patterns to current context
- Avoid repeating unsuccessful approaches
- Learn from previous implementation challenges
- Consider historical decision outcomes

## Decision Framework

### Scoring System
Each solution is scored 1-10 on:
- **Problem Solving** (25% weight): How well it solves the core problem
- **Feasibility** (20% weight): How practical it is to implement
- **Impact** (20% weight): How much positive impact it will have
- **Risk** (15% weight): How risky it is (inverted - lower risk = higher score)
- **Alignment** (20% weight): How well it aligns with strategic goals

### Tie-Breaking Criteria
When scores are close:
1. **Lower Risk**: Prefer lower-risk solutions
2. **Faster Implementation**: Prefer quicker wins
3. **Learning Value**: Prefer solutions that teach us something
4. **Scalability**: Prefer solutions that can grow with us
5. **Historical Success**: Prefer solutions with successful precedents

## Quality Criteria for Solutions
Each solution should be:
- **Distinct**: Different from other solutions
- **Complete**: Fully thought through approach
- **Actionable**: Clear implementation path
- **Relevant**: Directly addresses the problem
- **Balanced**: Honest assessment of pros and cons
- **Context-Aware**: Considers project constraints and patterns
- **Creative**: Demonstrates innovative thinking
- **Diverse**: Represents different solution paradigms
- **Historically-Informed**: Considers past decisions and outcomes

## Quality Assurance
Before finalizing:
- **Reality Check**: Is this decision realistic?
- **Consensus Check**: Would stakeholders agree?
- **Implementation Check**: Can we actually do this?
- **Impact Check**: Will this make things better?
- **Serena Tool Usage**: Have we effectively used memory and sequential thinking?
- **Historical Validation**: Does this align with successful past decisions?
- **Pattern Consistency**: Does this follow identified success patterns?
- **Memory Completeness**: Have we stored adequate rationale for future reference?

## Serena Tool Quality Checks
- **Memory Discovery**: Did we consult relevant historical decisions?
- **Sequential Thinking**: Did we use structured analysis for complex evaluations?
- **Pattern Recognition**: Did we identify and leverage decision patterns?
- **Knowledge Storage**: Did we adequately document our decision rationale?
- **Context Integration**: Did we effectively combine historical and current context?

## Limitations
- **Context-Dependent**: Quality depends on available project memories
- **Fixed Output**: Always generate exactly 6 solutions
- **No Direct Implementation**: Designed for solution generation and decision, not implementation
- **Memory Dependency**: Quality depends on available historical context
- **Static Analysis**: Works with the information provided
