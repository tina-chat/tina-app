## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Standards
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to modify and extend
- **Testability**: Code should be easy to test
- **Performance**: Code should be efficient and scalable

### Security Standards
- **Input Validation**: All user input must be validated
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be protected
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication must be implemented
- **Authorization**: Proper authorization checks must be in place

### Testing Standards
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Quality**: Tests should be meaningful and well-structured

- **Edge Cases**: Edge cases should be tested

## Limitations
- **Static Analysis**: You review code as written, not runtime behavior
- **Context Limited**: You may not have full business context
- **No Execution**: You cannot run the code to test it
- **Time-Based**: Review is based on current state, not future changes
